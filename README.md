 🚗 Automatic Headlight Beam Controller using OpenCV

This project uses a webcam and computer vision techniques to **automatically switch between high and low beam headlights** based on real-time detection of oncoming light sources. It's designed to reduce glare for other drivers during night driving and enhance road safety.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔦 **Bright Light Detection:** Detects intense light sources (like oncoming headlights) and switches to low beam automatically.
- 🚫 **Red Light Filtering:** Ignores rear vehicle tail lights using color masking.
- 🧠 **Region-Based Analysis:** Focuses on lower half of the frame to detect distant vehicles more accurately.
- ⏱️ **Time-based Decision Reset:** If no light is detected for a certain time, system reverts to high beam.
- 🔍 **Debug Mode:** Toggle visualizations like grayscale, red mask, thresholds, and overlays for analysis.

## 📸 Demo / Screenshots
- **High Intensity Light** is detected from each frame

- Image is coverted to **grayscale** and then high intensity points are recognized and the beam is signalled to change
